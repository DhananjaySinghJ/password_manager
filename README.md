Password Manager
Password Manager is a simple Python application built using the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to generate secure passwords and store them along with website and email credentials.

Features
Password Generation: Users can generate random passwords of varying length with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
Password Storage: Users can save website URLs, email addresses, and passwords securely.
User-Friendly Interface: The application provides a clean and intuitive user interface for ease of use.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Required Python libraries: tkinter, pyperclip (for copying passwords to the clipboard).
Usage
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the password_manager.py file using Python:
python password_manager.py

The Password Manager application window will open.
Use the "Generate password" button to create a random password.
Enter the website URL, email address, and password, then click "Add" to save the credentials.
All saved credentials are stored in the data.txt file in the project directory.
Notes
Make sure to keep the data.txt file secure as it contains sensitive information.
Customize the password length and complexity by modifying the generate_password function in the password_manager.py file.
